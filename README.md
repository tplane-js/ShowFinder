# RedHat Coding Test:

  - clone repo
  - cd into it, npm install
  - npm start to run the app
  - npm run test to run tests
  


Available features:
  - Debugged and fixed remoteMathService.js (available in root directory)
  - created unit tests for remoteMathService.js (run npm run test)
  - Created sample application that's fetching user data from remote API endpoint (npm start), with user details page being fully bookmarkable (npm start, http://localhost:3000/)
  - Created Alert Page / Modal components and styled them with vanilla CSS as per design doc (npm start and then click on "Alert Page" link on top or go to http://localhost:3000/alertpage)
 
Notes:

> These are simple implementations that lack full abstraction, reusability and such. But they could be used as a starting point towards developing a code base that would follow best practices.
